# Healthcare Guardrails Assistant

A simple AI-powered Healthcare Assistant built using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **MistralAI** to demonstrate how **Guardrails** can make AI applications safer and more reliable.

This project showcases a multi-layer guardrail architecture, including input validation, PII protection, human approval, and output validation.

# Guardrails Implemented

## 1. Healthcare Safety Filter

Blocks harmful or non-healthcare related requests before they reach the LLM.

Examples:

* Bomb making
* Weapons
* Hacking
* Drug synthesis
* Self-harm

---

## 2. PII Redaction

Automatically detects and redacts sensitive user information before sending it to the model.

Example:

```
Input:
My email is john@gmail.com
```

↓

```
My email is [REDACTED]
```

---

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop

Appointment booking requires manual approval before execution.

Flow:

```
User
   │
   ▼
Book Appointment
   │
   ▼
Pause
   │
Approve / Reject
   │
   ▼
Execute
```

---

## 4. Medical Output Validator

Automatically appends a medical disclaimer to every AI response.

Example:

```
Disclaimer:
This is general health information and should not be considered professional medical advice.
Please consult a qualified healthcare provider.
```
